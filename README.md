In this program the user is going to enter a sentence and then choose whether to change it completly to Upper case or Lower case, or to a special case where he choose a letter 
only one letter to change, in this project I learned how to deal with stringes change them to Upper/Lower case, how to store a special string and analyis it accordingly, and 
how to declare a function in a headerfile defining it in another c file and using it in the main file with compiling and linking all of them.
It was a nice experience.
